# BAI_processing
BAI files are used in the Finance and Banking industry. Each line begins with a code that tells you what the data in that line is for. This parser reads all the data from each line, and puts it in a CSV format that will allow it to be uploaded to databases or placed in plain .TXT files for easy processing.

The parser is not ready to use in its current state. If you have questions about it, please reach out to me.
